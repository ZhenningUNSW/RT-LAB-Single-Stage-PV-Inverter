\begin{abstract}
The review of current design of single phase grid-connected photovoltaic system, initial model of the system and the concept of hardware-in-the-loop simulation are presented in this paper. A model of the system including solar cell model, MPPT controller, converter controller are developed both in Matlab and RT-LAB. Some initial results demonstrate the overall system performance.

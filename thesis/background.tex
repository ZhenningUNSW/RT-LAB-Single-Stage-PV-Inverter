\chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}

Every semester, students ask their supervisor how to write their thesis,
what the requirements are, and what to write in it.  
This document tries to answer all such questions.

\section{Previous work}

Previously, Nooshabadi~\cite{Noo05} has described style-related thesis
requirements, Shepherd~\cite{She05} has provided \LaTeX\ templates while
other academics have discussed contents with their students.  This work
draws all the relevant information regarding thesis writing into one
document.  The previous versions of the present template/document was heavily
influenced by Nooshabadi and Shepherd, while the current version reflects recent
changes in the submission procedures, and improves the \LaTeX\ template.

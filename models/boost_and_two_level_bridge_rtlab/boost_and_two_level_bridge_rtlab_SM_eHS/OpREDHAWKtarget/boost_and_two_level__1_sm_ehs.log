Flashing FPGA #0 bitstream. This can take some time. Do not reset your target until flash_update completes.


Flashing FPGA #0 bitstream : '/home/laptop-5fbkhmjv/users/jiang/opal-rt/rt-labv11_workspace/pv_inverter/models/boost_and_two_level_bridge_rtlab/boost_and_two_level_bridge_rtlab_sm_ehs/MMPK7_1-EX-0001-2_3_2_19-300Series_eHSgen3_with_IOs-303-03.bin' ...
WARNING: Flash programming was skipped because the same bitstream was already programmed in the FPGA.
Note that you can set the User Variable FPGA_BITSTREAM_FORCE_OPTION to ON for forcing the reprogramming of the board.
